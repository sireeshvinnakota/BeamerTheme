Created by [Sireesh Vinnakota](https://sites.uci.edu/sireesh) (cobbled together from a few sources cited in the preamble). Please feel free to reach out with requests for more universities, suggestions for edits, and new feature requests.

## How to Get Started
The template consists of five items (6 files):

 1. TalkTemplate.pdf- a sample output of the template
 2. TalkTemplate.tex- This is a toy template to showcase the features, as well as be a bank for common copy-paste blocks.
 3. beamerThemeLogic.sty- This is the code that generates the title slide, features, and anything that is not university-specific.
 4. beamerTheme[university]Math.sty- These are the colors, details, and general feel of the presentation. Use this to edit the aesthetic
 5. .pngs- These denote the logos that are displayed on each slide.
